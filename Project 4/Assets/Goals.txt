Our goal is to create a dungeon system that the player will fight monsters (potentially together with
a teammate) and protect an npc that tags along, asking the player(s) for help.

Some of the mechanics we want to implement include..
- NPC Dialogue?
- Combat
- Monster AI
- Multiplayer using Networking
